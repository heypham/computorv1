# Computorv1 

The purpose of this project is to write a program that solves simple polynomial equations.
The program takes a polynomial equation up to degree 2 and should display  
- A reduced form of the equation  
- The degree of the equation  
- Its solution(s) and the polarity of the discriminant if it makes sense
